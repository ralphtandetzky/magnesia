# Magnesia

A numerical math library for Rust featuring

* Polynomials
* Vectors and Matrices
* Complex Numbers

The goal of Magnesia is to provide an easy to use yet efficient API for mathematical applications. Magnesia's interfaces are designed such that extensions and zero overhead implementations are possible. Dependencies from other crates are kept to a minimum. Currently, there are no build dependencies.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
```text
[dependencies]
magnesia = "0.11.1"
```

## Documentation

Please find the reference documentation [here on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/magnesia/latest/magnesia/).

## Contributing

Contributions are highly welcome. In fact, I would be happy to have a sparring partner for development. To contribute, please send me a pull request via github. It doesn't have to be perfect at first, but expect feedback before merges into the main repository.
