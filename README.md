# Magnesia

A math library for Rust featuring

* Polynomials
* Vectors and Matrices
* Complex Numbers

The goal of Magnesia is to provide an easy to use yet efficient API for mathematical applications. Magnesia may not be feature rich and optimized yet, but its interfaces are designed such that extensions and zero overhead implementations are possible.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
```text
[dependencies]
magnesia = "0.8.2"
```

## Documentation

Please find the reference documentation [here on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/magnesia/latest/magnesia/).
