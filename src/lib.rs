//! A math library for Rust featuring
//! * Polynomials
//!
//! # Goal and Scope
//!
//! The goal of Magnesia is to provide an easy to use yet efficient API for
//! mathematical applications.
//! Magnesia may not be feature rich and optimized yet, but its interfaces are
//! designed such that extensions and zero overhead implementations are
//! possible.
//!
//! In the future the package shall contain the following features as well:
//! * Vectors and Matrices
//! * Complex numbers and Quaternions
//! * Fast Fourier Transform
//! * Symbolic and numerical differentiation
//! * Numerical Optimization
//! * Root finding
//! * Interpolation
//! * Integration and solving differential equations
//! * Geometrical primitives
//! * Etc.
//! Contributions for this cause are highly welcome!
